##Data Set Information:

The variability of consumer engagement is analysed through a Principal Component Analysis, highlighting the changes induced by the use of Facebook Live. The seasonal component is analysed through a study of the averages of the different engagement metrics for different time-frames (hourly, daily and monthly). Finally, we identify statistical outlier posts, that are qualitatively analyzed further, in terms of their selling approach and activities.
