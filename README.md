# Parameter_Optimization of SVM
College Assignment for UCS654

## About SVM and Parameter Optimization
Support Vector Machine or SVM is one of the most popular Supervised Learning algorithms, which is used for Classification as well as Regression problems. However, primarily, it is used for Classification problems in Machine Learning.

Some of the most important parameters of SVM such as kernel, C, and gamma can be changed in order to achieve a higher accuracy. This is called as Hyperparameter Tuning.

We can perform this task using GridSearchCV for optimizing these parameters.

In this python file, I've used a Fitness Function to optimize the parameters.

## Data Set Information:

The variability of consumer engagement is analysed through a Principal Component Analysis, highlighting the changes induced by the use of Facebook Live. The seasonal component is analysed through a study of the averages of the different engagement metrics for different time-frames (hourly, daily and monthly). Finally, we identify statistical outlier posts, that are qualitatively analyzed further, in terms of their selling approach and activities.
